I'm sorry to write a feed back there, since i don't find the Reflection.txt
I have two questions.
First, when i trid to change the introduction, i failed.
It tell me that i am the read only editor so that i can't change. 
I want to know why.
Second, the IBI_2019-20 files i read on the GitKraken and on my local computer where i store it is different.  
I am a bit confused about it.
By taking this pra, i leran more about the GitKraken. 
However, I should pay more time to practure.
Thank you very much.
